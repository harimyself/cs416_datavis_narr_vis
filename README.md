## CS416 Data Visualization: Narrative Visualization
### Author: hbojja2@illinois.edu


<br></br>
#### Summary
This page was constructed based on the `data-science-job-salaries` dataset from kaggle. The idea is to understand the data science job market between the years 2020 to 2022. For this we have chosen 7 most interesting jobs titles from the full set of 41 different jobs.

The goal of this narrative visualization is show 
1. Which of 7 Data Science or AI jobs has highest paying salary and in which year? 
2. Which year between 2020-2022 a particular job title has highest salary?

<br></br>

#### Narrative Structure.
The visualization follows `interactive slideshow` designs to illustrate the data.


Does the narrative visualization follow that structure?
